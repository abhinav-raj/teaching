    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. Jupyter Notebook is maintained by the people at [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are a spin\\-off project from the IPython project, which used to have an IPython Notebook project itself. The name, Jupyter, comes from the core supported programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R. Jupyter ships with the IPython kernel, which allows you to write your programs in Python, but there are currently over 100 other kernels that you can also use."

The most popular is CPython, which is the reference version of Python that you can get from their [website](https://www.python.org/). It is also assumed that you are using **Python 3**."
